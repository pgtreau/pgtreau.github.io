# Science Fundamentals
### What is science?
Science is the body of knowledge derived from the use of a systematic method for acquiring and organizing information about the natural world through observations and experiments. The fundamental principles of science include:
1) Empirical evidence: theories and phenomenas are based on empirical observations and experiments
2) The scientific method: The use of a systematic method to gather knowledge.
	- Making observations
	- Formulating a hypothesis
	- Gathering & analyzing data
	- Drawing a conclusing
	- Publishing results
3) Falsifiability
4) Generation of theory

### What is an academic discipline?
Key features of a discipline are:
- **Body of knowledge:** Each discipline has a defined body of knowledge that consist of key concepts, theories, practices that have developed over time.
- **Methods:** Disciplines have recognized methods for gathering and interpreting data.
- **Journals and publications:** Allowing for discourse and dissemination surrounding new ideas
- **Academic training:** Typically includes university programs (majors) in the discipline.
- **Evolution over time:** Based on new discoveries, technologies, or methodologies.

### What is a theory?
A theory is a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world that is based on a body of evidence that has been repeatedly confirmed through observations and experimentation. 

Key attributes of a theory:
1) **Based on evidence:** Theories are grounded in empirical evidence, is the result of consistent observations
2) **Explanatory power:** Provides explanations to phenomena *(answers "why?")*
3) **Predictive power:** Ability to make predictions that can be tested. If they hold true, they lend further support to the theory.
4) **Falsifiability:** For a theory to be scientific it  needs to be structured so that some evidence could prove it wrong.

### What makes for a theoretical contribution?
Refers to the addition or modification to existing theory in a manner that advances understanding or provide new perspective. It enhances the existing body of knowledge. 

Theoretical contributions can come in various forms:
1) **Conceptual clarification:** Adds details to concepts or constructs.
2) **Introduce new concepts or theories:** Proposing new constructs or frameworks for a fresh way to explain a phenomena.
3) **Bridging existing theories:** Linking theories to explain a phenomenon better.
4) **Challenging current theories:** Theory testing, suggesting alternatives
5) **Extending a theory:** Applying existing theory to a new context.
6) **Empirical validation:** Solidifying a theory by providing empirical support.
For research to be considered a valuable contribution it should meet the following criteria:
1) **Originality:** Offer something novel - either a new perspective, a new concept, or a new linkage.
2) **Relevance:** Addresses a gap in the body of knowledge.
3) **Rigor:** Theoretical arguments are well grounded, logically constructed, and rooted in the literature.
4) **Generalizability:** Applicable beyond a narrow context.

#### Types of research contributions
1) **Describes** the world (phenomenological)
2) Determines **recommended** courses of actoin based on empirics (prescriptive)
| |Prescriptive|Descriptive|
|--|--|--|
|**Highly structured:**<br/> <sup>data + algorithms</sup>| Engineering <br/><sup>(analytical/prescriptve)</sup> | OM & Econometrics<br/><sup>(causal)</sup>|
|**Less structured**: <br/> <sup>interviews & observations</sup> | Principles<br/><sup>(normative)</sup> | Case studies <br/> <sup>(explorative)</sup>|

**Prescriptive:** what people aught to do. Normally based on finding optimal outcome.
**Normative:** what is right or wrong to do, irrespective of optimality.

**(Newman, 1956):** the best theories are the result of effects to understand real phenomenon.

#### Value of strong empirical research
1) Identify and verify important phenomena
2) Idenfity and characterize important questions
3) Validate model assumptions
4) Establish relevance of research

#### Types of research 
**Mode 1:** Knowledge development
**Mode 2:** Application of knowledge

#### Outputs of research
- Constructs
- System descriptions
- Analytical models
- Forecasts
- Recommendations

### Making a causal claim
Establishing causation requires the following:
1) **Covariation or association:** There must be a consistent correlation observed between the two variables.
2) **Temporal precedence:** The cause (independent variable) must precede the effect (dependent variable) in time. Cause before the effect.
3) **Elimination of alternative explanation:** Demonstration that no confounding variables can provide alternative explanation (exogeneity).

### Logical Reasoning
**Deductive** reasoning
	- Top down logic, begins with conclusion (hypothesis)
	- If premises are true, then conclusion must be true
	- Used in theory testing
**Inductive** reasoning
	- Begins with observation
	- Premises provide non-absolute support for conclusion
	- Based on these observations, an explanation is likely this.
**Abductive** reasoning
	- Testing multiple theories (rules) based on an observed conclusion
	- Under what precondition does the rule hold?

### Relevance of research
**Construct validity**
	Variables actually measure the concepts they intend to measure.
**Internal validity**
	The study actually measures the relationships by factors described and not other factors.
**External validity**
	Results are valid in similar settings outside the study.
**Reliability**
	Results are replicable.
Other research quality factors includes:
	- Systematic
	- Rigorous
	- Repeatable
	- Easy to follow
# Research Method
### Empirical Research in OM
1) **Research begings** with a general statement of the problem.
	- Issue or question to answer.
2) **Literature review**
	- Discover and show gap in existing knowledge.
3) Specify the **aim** and **objective**, or **purpose**
	- What is the contribution?
4) Determine the specific **research question**
5) Chose the optimal **approach** or **method**
6) Develop a **conceptual framework**
7) **Data collection**
8) **Analysis**
9) **Synthesis** and **conclusion**
### Methods to assert causality
- **Randomized controlled experiments**
- **Natural experiments**
- **Statistical Controls**: Using statistical methods, researchers can control for the influence of potential confounding variables.
- **Longitudinal Studies**: These studies track participants over time and can help establish temporal precedence.
- **Mediation Analyses**: Demonstrating that the relationship between two variables is explained through a third variable (mediator) can provide evidence for the mechanism of the causal process.
- **Cross-Lagged Panel Designs**: (Diff in diff) This design involves measuring two variables at two different points in time. It can help establish which variable precedes the other, lending support to causal claims.
- **Theoretical Grounding**: Having a solid theoretical basis for expecting a causal relationship can bolster the claim. If there's a well-understood mechanism or process behind the expected causation, the claim is more compelling.

# Operations Management
## What is operations management?
Operations management is the management of *work*. *Work* is the transformation process to convert inputs into outputs  in a business. The operation function:
	- Designs,
	- Makes, and
	- delivers
an organizations **product** or **service**.
![[Pasted image 20230627135836.png|500]]

#### Three types of operation process
1) [[Procurement]]
2) [[Production]]
3) [[Fulfullment]]

## History of Operations Management
Operations management, in a broad sense, began with the early 1900s scientific management work theories of Frederick W. Taylor (1856–1915).
- Took artisanal work and broke it down to short, repetitive tasks
- Introduced the concept of time studies

**Henry Ford** was an early practitioner of scientific management.

Professor **Elton Mayo** (1880–1949) found that workers, unlike machines, respond positively to personal attention and job enrichment. _(Socio-tech aspect of OM)_

**World War II** demanded productivity from limited resources, and several resource-optimization and logicbased approaches to work decisions appeared, such as PERT/CPM (program evaluation and review technique/ critical path method) and linear programming.

Complex **mass production systems** grew, with the invention of computers and automated machinery in the 1950s and ’60s.

Competition and rising customer demands for cost and quality performance in the ’70s and ’80s stimulated the introduction of manufacturing process improvement practices such as JIT (just-in-time) and TQM (total **quality** management)

The growth of information and web technology in the ’90s facilitated management visibility and control of large enterprises and parts of their supply network, birthing the practices of **off-shoring**, **e-commerce**, and **supply chain management**.

Today OM is concerned with productivity, innovation, sustainability, supply chain resiliency.

## Theories in Operations Management
**Swift even flow theory** (Schmenner & Swink, 1998)
	- The most productive systems are those which WIP flows swiftly through the system.
**Queueing Theory** (Erlang, 1904)
	- Invented to determine the capacity requirements of the Danish telephone system.
**Theory of constraints** (Goldratt, 1984)
	- System improvements are limitted by their bottleneck. Efforts should be focused there to improve system efficiency.
**Theory of performance frontier** (Schmenner & Swink, 1998; Vastag, 2000)
	- The maximum performance that can be achieved by a system given a set of operating choices in the performance frontier.
	- Structural or technological changes are usually needed to expand the frontier.
**Competitive progression theory** (Rosenzweig, 2004)
	- Extends the **sand  cone model**
	- Describes how the firms step up the ladder of competitive priorities
	- Quality -> Delivery reliability -> Process flexibility -> Price leadership
**Product-process matrix** (Hayes & Wheelwright, 1978)
	- Relationship between volume and variety in a production process
**Littlewood's rule** (1972)
	- A price should be accepted when it exceeds the expected value of a sale in the future.
**Lean theories**
	- Includes *pull scheduling*, *TQM*, *Swift even flow*, *5S*, *Just-in-time*...
**Bullwhip effect**
	- Explains the relationship between information sharing and demand planning.
**Resource based view** (Barney, 1991)
	- Firm's sustained competitive advantage is based on its portfolio of core competencies.
	- Make or buy decisions should be based on core competencies.
**Transaction cost economics** (Williamson, 1979)
	- Make or buy decisions should be made to minimize transaction costs.
**Inventory theory** 
	- Founded on EOQ (Harris, 1913)
		- Outlines the ideal order size for every product a firm buys.
	- Newsvendor Model (Edgeworth, 1888)
	- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inventory_theory
**Kano model** (1980's)
	- Theory for product development and customer satisfaction
	- States that there are different categories of quality
		- Basic quality (must have, go no-go)
		- Performance quality (nice to have, more is better)
		- Excitement quality (unexpected, absence not negative)
	- As customers become acustom to a feature, it can change quality type
		- e.g. performance to basic
**Game Theory** (von Newman, 1940's)
**Systems Theory** (Bertalanffy, 1940's)
**Agency Theory** (Mitnick, 1970's)

# Inventory Management
## Inventory Intro
- The first paper on inventory theory was from **Ford W. Harris** in **1913**, named "How many parts to make at once". This work is now know as the Economic Order Quantity **(EOQ)**.
- First models were deterministic, dealing with simple models with consistent parameters, known demand and known cost. 
- Followed by stochastic models that incorporate uncertainty in demand and supply.
- Followed by multi-echelon system to consider pooling inventory.
- Field has integrated with other domains like pricing and sustainability.
#### Types of inventory
1) **Anticipated stock** (reduce peak capacity need)
2) **Cycle stock** (Based on ordering frequency)
3) **Safety stock** (Mitigate uncertainty in demand and lead time)
4) **Pipeline stock** (Expected demand over lead time)
5) **Decoupling stock** (Safety stock for internal process)
#### Fundamental questions of inventory management
1) **What** items should be stocked in a system?
2) **Where** should items be stocked?
	- Stores vs. warehouses?
	- All locations vs. single location?
	- Owner vs. supplier warehouse?
3) **How much** should be ordered when an order is placed?
4) **When** should an order by placed?

- _Inventory modeling focuses on Q3 & Q4
#### Factors affecting inventory policies
1) **Inventory system structure**
	- Manners that goods flow through supply chain
	- Number of echelons![[SupplyChainStructure.excalidraw]]
	- Owner at each echolon
2) **Items being stocked**
	- Number of items
	- Item size and amount of space
	- Price vairability
	- Obsolescence or perishability
4) **Market characteristics**
	- Demand rate/variability
	- A,B,C item criticality
5) **Lead time**
	- Supplier responsiveness
	- Customer expectations
6) **Cost**
	- Holding cots
	- Receiving/processing costs
	- Stockout costs
	- Obsolescence costs
	- Purchasing costs
	- Bulk discounts

#### Inventory performance
Inventory represent a sizable portion of assets on a balance sheet. Unproductive assets can limit a firm's performance. Inventory productivity has a direct positive impact on firm financial performance (Alan et al., 2014).

In management accounting, inventory is considered a short-term asset because it is stocked for a limited duration until sold or used.
##### Measures of inventory performance
The main tradeoff in inventory management is dealing with demand uncertainty by balancing excess inventory and stock-outs. More advance models also consider order frequency as a tradeoff between holding costs and ordering costs.
- Days of inventory
	- Average amount of time that a unit is kept in stock.
	- Affected by supplier lead time and customer lead time.
	- Demand uncertainty can also affect stock decisions.
- Inventory turnover
	- How many times a year is inventory fully replenished.
	- Inverse measure compared to days of inventory.
	- $Inventory Turnover = \frac{COGS}{Average Inventory Level}$
	- Values found in financial statements.
	- Affects Return on Asset (ROA)
		- $ROA = ProfitMargin * InventoryTurnover * \frac{AverageInventory}{TotalAssets}$

## Deterministic Models
As there is no demand uncertainty, these models are concerned with balancing the **tradeoff** between **ordering costs** and **holding costs**

### 1) Economic Order Quantity
- **(Arrow et al., 1950)**
- Simple model with restrictive assumptions
- Optimal solution is closed form
- Goal to pick order quantity and reorder point (when & how much)
- $S^* = \sqrt{Kx/(c-b_1x)}$
	- $b_1$ = marginal cost of one additional unit
	- K = ordering/handling cost
	- x = demand rate
	- c = carrying cost

### 2) Economic Production Quantity
- While EOQ assumes that replenishment is instantaneous, EPQ assumes gradual "production" to replenish inventory.
- Concerned with when to began production to avoid stockout because of gradual replenishment.
- If the production rate does not meet the demand rate then buffer pipeline stock must be planned to deal with seasonal surge demand.
- Production setup cost should be considered similar to EOQ ordering costs
- Given these challenges, the EPQ model's central aim is to determine the optimal production batch size that balances the setup (or order) cost and holding cost, ensuring that production is efficient while meeting demand without excessive stock holding.

### 3) Continuous vs Periodic Review System
Continuous: EOQ-RoP
Periodic: EOQ
Deterministic models don't really need a review system as we know exactly when inventory will be depleted.
## Stochastic Models
The stochastic models observe the tradeoff between **excess inventory costs** and **stock-out costs**.

### 1) Single-Period Inventory Model (Newsvendor)
- Known as **Newsvendor Model** **(Scarf, 1958)**
- Goal is to determine the optimal inventory level $Q$ when demand is uncertain.
- Tradeoff between excess **inventory** and **stock-outs**
##### Newsvendor Critical Fractile Solution
- The optimal order quantity can be calculated based on **critical fractile**
	1) $\alpha^* = F(Q^*) = \frac{p-c}{p-s}$ 
	2) $z^* = \Phi^{-1}(\alpha^*)$
	3) $Q^* = \mu + z^*\sigma$
		- $\alpha^*$ = critical fractile
		- $p$ = selling price per unit
		- $s$ = residual value of unsold unit (clearance price)
		- $c$ = cost per unit

### 2) Multi-Period Models

#### 1) Periodic Review - Base-stock Model
- In this basic model a certain stock level is held. At each period, for every sale a order is placed with the supplier to replenish so that the **inventory position** is always equal to the **base-stock level**.
- This model is closed-form only if **backorders** are accepted.
- Otherwise, a Monte-Carlo simulation can be applied.
**Weakness**
- One of the assumptions is that there is no fixed ordering cost
##### Inventory Position
$\text{Inventory Position} = \text{On-hand Inventory} + \text{On-transit} - Backorders$
##### Base-Stock Critical Fractile Solution
- When backorders are allowed, the closed form solution is critical fractile
	1) $\alpha^{*} = F_{l+1}(S^*) = \frac{b}{b+h}$
	2) $z^* = \Phi^{-1}(\alpha^*)$
	3) $S^* = \mu + z^*\sigma$
		- $b$ = unit backorder costs for one period
		- $h$ = unit holding costs for one period
		- $S^*$ = optimal base-stock level

#### 2) Continuous Review - Reorder Point
- When there are **fixed ordering costs**, we aim to reduce the frequency of orders.
- The reorder point model has two decision variables:
	- Reorder point
	- Order quantity
- These variables sets the ordering cycle (frequency) based on their values.
	- The duration between two consecutive orders is not fixed, but based on reorder point.
	- We can measure an average ordering cycle duration ($Q/\lambda$).
- Deals with two tradeoffs:
	- fixed costs and supply-demand mismatch (stockout risk) costs
	- backorder and holding costs
- We can solve using two equations, two unknowns:
	1)  $Q^* = \sqrt{\frac{2\lambda(K+bE(max(D-R,0)))}{h}}$
	2)  $1-F_l(R^*) = \frac{hQ^*}{b\lambda}$
		- $\lambda$ = demand rate
		- $K$ = fixed ordering cost 
		- $b$ = backorder cost 
		- $h$ = holding cost
		- $D$ = random demand
		- $R$ = reorder level
		- $Q$ = order quantity
		- $F_l$ = probability distribution of demand during lead time


## Multi-Echelon Models
- Optimal policies considering the cost and operation of multiple echelons of inventory (depot, retail...)
- Centralizing inventory in a depot reduces demand variability
### 1) Introduction and Significance:
Benefits and challenges of coordinated inventory management.
### 2) Centralized vs. Decentralized Systems
System comparisons and optimal policies.
### 3) Information Flow - Bullwhip Effect
### 4) Real World Example - Challenges
- Gov of Canada purchased more vaccine doses than there are citizens in the country.
- This was done as there was a mismatched between demand timing, demand location, and inventory availability
- Gov decided to prioritize no-stockout vs. spoilage.
### 5) Future Research Direction
- In the face of supply chain resilience research, there is an opportunity to consider game theoretical approach to inventory management when faced with competition in procuring suppliers (limited demand)
- - Impact on competition on inventory management
	- price battles between retaillers/brands
- Monopolistic inventory management in remote communities
	- e.g. Dollar general
- Single product vs. multi product categories
	- e.g. Trader Joe's vs. Traditional grocer

### RM Steps
- Segment customers
- Demand forecasting
	- per segment/time/location
- 
### Real world example
- In 2014 Brazil were expecting an influx of travelers for the FIFA world cup. Prices at hotels were increased accordingly. However, hotel demand ended up lower than previous years as customers deemed the price too high.
	- Average hotel prices were set higher than the average in North America or Europe, not considering that consumers could consider alternatives.
	- Most hotels tried to target luxury guests although the majority of World Cup attendance are middle class consumers.
### Future Research
- RM links the right seat (product), with the right customer, at the right price. Future research looking at the "right distribution channel" is an opportunity for improvement.
- How an entrepreneurial venture use RM against monopolistic conglomerates. 
## Queuing Theory

> [!Little's Law (1961)]+
the average number of items within a system equals the average arrival rate of items into and out of the system multiplied by the average amount of time an item spends in the system.
$$ L = \lambda W $$
Where:
$L$ = average length of queue.
$\lambda$ = average arrival rate
$W$ = average processing time


## New Product & Service Development

### Function of product/service design department
1) Fulfill customer wants & needs
2) Refice existing product/service
3) Develop new product/service
4) Formulate quality goals
5) Formulate cost targets
6) Construct & test prototypes
7) Document specifications
8) Translate product specs into process specs

### Product lifecycle
![[CachedImage.jpeg|500]]
**Intro:** product is novel, design term is working out the bugs.
**Growth:** Desing improvements are made, reliability gets better, costs fall.
**Maturity:** Few design changes are made, costs are low, productivity is high. New uses may extend the life of the product or increase market size.
**Decline:** Decision whether to discontinue or replace product.

* _Some essential products do not exhibit a lifecycle curve, but most new products do._

### Degree of Standardization
