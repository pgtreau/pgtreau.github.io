## Session 2: How value is created

**Value Proposition**: This is the unique value a company promises to deliver to customers if they choose its product or service. It differentiates the company's offering from competitors and provides a compelling reason for customers to choose it. It is important for marketers to understand exactly how their offering differs from the competition.

**Competitive advantage**: When a value proposition is difficult to replicate by competitors a firm is said to have a competitive advantage.
